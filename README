This project implements a modified version of the ConDenSation algorithm, and can track up to two people in real time. Notably, it supports depth information provided by stereo cameras and uses this to improve tracking quality.

- Warning -

Compiling and running this will be pretty difficult for almost anyone, so I'm looking to change that. It currently requires the OpenCV library, and test data to run upon.
Later versions will include a test data set, and tools with which to create your own.
